# Assignment Statements, Input and Output
My very first programming assignment involving assignment statements, input and output.

## Problem 1 Scenario: Time Conversions

The problem is to convert the number of seconds into the corresponding number of hours, minutes and seconds.  Develop an application that will read in the number of seconds and convert this number into an equivalent number of hours, minutes (0-59), and seconds (0-59).  For example, 9999 seconds is equivalent to 2 hours, 46 minutes and 39 seconds.

## Problem 2 Scenario: Payroll

Payroll is one of the most important function of an organization. Errors in payroll calculations will result in employee dissatisfaction.  Hence, it is often one of the first applications developed.  You will develop a simple payroll application as your second problem.

## Problem 3 Scenario: Projectile Motion

Projectile motion is one of the most studied motions in Classical Physics.  Knowledge of projectile motion allow us to perform many functions such as throwing a football, archery, etc.  In this scenario, you will create a Java program that will receive the initial velocity and the angle and determine the flight path information for the projectile.
